In the Real-Time Streaming SDK, monitoring the state of your instances is crucial for managing and troubleshooting your streaming sessions.

The SDK provides a dedicated page to check the current state of your instances, categorized into two main types: `RoomState` and `AIAvatarState`.

## RoomState

The Room State refers to the current status of the `VmonsterRoom` instance, which may include various operational conditions.

Understanding the `VmonsterRoom` State helps you manage the live sessions effectively.

| State   | Description                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| idle    | This state occurs after the `VmonsterRoom` object is created and before the AIAvatar Stream connection begins. The state transitions back to idle when the `left` event occurs. |
| joining | Represents the period when the AIAvatar Stream connection is initializing but not yet completed.                                                                                |
| joined  | Indicates that the AIAvatar Stream connection has successfully completed.                                                                                                       |

## AIAvatarState

The AIAvatar State reflects the status and activity of the agent associated with the `VmonsterRoom`.

As a crucial component in handling interactions.

| State    | Description                                                                                                                                                                            |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| none     | This state is present after the creation of the `VmonsterRoom` object and before the AIAvatar Stream connection is complete. The state switches to none when the `left` event happens. |
| idle     | Indicates that the AIAvatar Stream connection has been completed successfully.                                                                                                         |
| loading  | The state when the `speak()` function is called, preparing for speech output.                                                                                                          |
| speaking | Indicates that the AIAvatar is currently speaking.                                                                                                                                     |
