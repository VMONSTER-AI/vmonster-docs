1. <b>VmonsterRoom Initialization:</b> A new room is created when the initialization
   process begins, setting the stage for communication between users and AI Avatars.

2. <b>AI Avatar Joining:</b> The AI Avatar joins the created room, becoming ready
   to interact with users within the session.

3. <b>User Joining:</b> The user then joins the room. After the user joins, the AI
   Avatar's stream data begins to be transmitted, facilitating a real-time interactive
   session.

4. <b>Text Request:</b> The system processes a request for a text-based speaking,
   initiating the interaction sequence.

5. <b>Transmission of Text for Speaking:</b> The text for the speaking is sent, preparing
   for the next phase of interaction.

6. <b>Transmission of Video Stream Data:</b> Finally, the video stream data is sent,
   completing the communication loop and enabling live interaction.
