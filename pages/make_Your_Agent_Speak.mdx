## [speak()](/pages/instance_Methods#speak)

To have the AI Avatar speak a message, use [`speak()`](/pages/instance_Methods#speak). This triggers the synthesize of speech video.

### Text Input

```typescript
room.speak({ text: "Hello. How can I assist you today?" });
```

### Streaming Input

In addition to standard text input, streaming input via an AsyncIterable is supported.

```typescript
// your AsyncIterable
const textStream = getAsyncIterable(response);

await room.speak({
  isStream: true,
  stream: textStream,
});
```
