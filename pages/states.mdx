In the real-time streaming SDK, monitoring the state of your instances is crucial for managing and troubleshooting your streaming sessions.

The SDK provides a dedicated page to check the current state of your instances, categorized into two main types: `RoomState` and `AIAvatarState`.

## RoomState

The `RoomState` refers to the current status of the `VmonsterRoom` instance, which may include various operational conditions.

Understanding the `VmonsterRoom` State helps you manage the live sessions effectively.

| State     | Description                                                                                                                                                                      |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `idle`    | This state occurs after the `VmonsterRoom` object is created and before the AI Avatar Stream connection begins. The state transitions back to idle when the `left` event occurs. |
| `joining` | Represents the period when the AI Avatar Stream connection is initializing but not yet completed.                                                                                |
| `joined`  | Indicates that the AI Avatar Stream connection has successfully completed.                                                                                                       |

## AIAvatarState

The `AIAvatarState` reflects the status and activity of the agent associated with the `VmonsterRoom`.

As a crucial component in handling interactions.

| State      | Description                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `none`     | This state is present after the creation of the `VmonsterRoom` object and before the AI Avatar Stream connection is complete. The state switches to none when the `left` event happens. |
| `idle`     | Indicates that the AI Avatar Stream connection has been completed successfully.                                                                                                         |
| `loading`  | The state when the `speak()` function is called, preparing for speech output.                                                                                                           |
| `speaking` | Indicates that the AI Avatar is currently speaking.                                                                                                                                     |
