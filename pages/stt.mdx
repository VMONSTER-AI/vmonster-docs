Text-to-speech (TTS) is a technology that converts audio input into text. It allows users to interact with AI Agents using their voice.

## How to use

There are two ways to use the speech-to-text feature:

- **Real-time TTS**: Transcribes incoming audio tracks in real time. Ideal when low-latency feedback is important.
- **Non-real-time TTS**: Transcribes audio blobs. Suitable when you already have a user audio recording implementation.

### Real-time TTS

This is the recommended approach. It connects to the user’s audio track and streams the transcription in real time. Transcription results are delivered via events.

```typescript
room.unmuteUserAudio(); // publish user audio and unmute

room.on("stt-data", (data) => {
  console.log(data);
  const { type, text, eventType } = data;
});
```
By default, transcription uses the same language as the agent.
If you’d like to detect the spoken language automatically, you can configure that when creating the stream. (link)


### Non-real-time TTS

This is a traditional approach that converts a recorded audio blob into text.

```typescript
const blob = await room.stopRecordingAudio();
const text = await room.stt(blob, "ko");
```
