1. **VmonsterRoom Initialization**: A new room is created when the initialization
   process begins, setting the stage for communication between users and AI Avatars.
2. **AI Avatar Joining**: The AI Avatar joins the created room, becoming ready
   to interact with users within the session.
3. **User Joining**: The user then joins the room. After the user joins, the AI
   Avatar's stream data begins to be transmitted, facilitating a real-time interactive
   session.
4. **Text Request**: The system processes a request for a text-based speaking, initiating the interaction sequence.
5. **Transmission of Text for Speaking**: The text for the speaking is sent, preparing
   for the next phase of interaction.
6. **Transmission of Video Stream Data**: Finally, the video stream data is sent, completing the communication loop and enabling live interaction.
