In the `VmonsterRoom`, several events of type `Event` may occur, which are essential for handling interactions and monitoring the state of the session.

The following are the key events:

---

<ParamField path="joining">
  Triggering when an attempt is made to connect the AI Avatar Stream. It occurs immediately upon calling the `join()` function.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="joined">
  Occuring when the AI Avatar Stream connection is successfully completed.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="left">
  Triggering when the AI Avatar Stream connection is terminated.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="aiavatar-start-speaking">
  Triggering when the AI Avatar begins speaking. It allows you to determine whether the AI Avatar is currently speaking.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="aiavatar-message">
  Occuring when the AI Avatar sends a message. It enables you to review messages sent by the AI Avatar.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="aiavatar-stop-speaking">
  Triggering when the AI Avatar stops speaking. It allows you to determine whether the AI Avatar is currently speaking.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="aiavatar-video-track">
  Triggering when the AI Avatar video track connected. Video MediaStream is passed to the callback.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="aiavatar-audio-track">
  Triggering when the AI Avatar audio track connected. Audio MediaStream is passed to the callback.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="stt-data" body="aa">
  Triggered repeatedly while the user’s audio is unmuted and they are speaking. It sends speech-to-text (STT) results one by one to the callback as STTData.

  ```typescript
  type STTDataEventType = "final" | "interim" | "interim_revert";
  type STTData = {
    text: string; // contains STT text.
    eventType: STTDataEventType;
    type: "stt-data";
  };
  ```

  `STTDataEventType`

  - `“final”` – The user has finished speaking. This is the final result and it will not change anymore.
  - `“interim”` – The user is still speaking. This is a temporary result that may change until the user finishes.
  - `“interim-revert”` – The previous “interim” result was wrong, so it has been cancelled or replaced.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="stt-start">
   Triggered when STT begins as the user’s audio is unmuted.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="stt-stop">
  Triggered when STT stops because the user’s audio is muted or unpublished.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="stt-error">
  Occurs when real-time STT cannot be performed successfully.
</ParamField>

## Handling Events

To attach callbacks to these events, use `on()` method.
