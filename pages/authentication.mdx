title: "Authentication"
---

To use the VMONSTER API, an authentication process must be completed.

During this process, an API Key is required. After obtaining the key, follow the usage instructions below.

## Usages

1. Create an Enterprise account on the [VMONSTER Studio](https://app.vmonster.io) and obtain an API Key.
2. Ensure that the issued API Key is not recorded in client-side web browser code and is kept confidential.
3. When sending API requests, include the key in the HTTP headers using the `x-api-key` field:

```js
headers: {
  'x-api-key': 'YOUR_API_KEY',
}
```

## Errors

- Requests made with an invalid key will result in a `403 Forbidden` error.
- If the `x-api-key` header is missing, a `422 Unprocessable Entity` error will occur.
